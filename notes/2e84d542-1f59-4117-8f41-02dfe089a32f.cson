  - [ ] Use Overleaf 2.0 for ENGR 004, create a template minus the lwarp and then add lwarp support at the very end, guess I  could travisci build 
  - [ ] Overleaf 2.0 when git support comes out, I'll go and submodule it my Job Hunting Repo.

  - [ ] vortex dapp with embark to test out the alternative to drizzle
  - [ ] ecommerce dapp using vortex, sotring images of ipfs and having some supply and pruchasing things with tokens? Or using two dapps, one for deploying tokens and one for ecommerce, perhaps manually deploy a tracker contract.
  - [x] Utilize uvic web space, use a gitlab repo, or circleCI repo, but I think I'll use gitlab because their are other files of interest I care about in that repo that I can submodule. [How to deploy any project using FTP with Gitlab Continous Integration (CI)? \\| mrkaluzny](https://mrkaluzny.com/how-to-deploy-any-project-using-ftp-with-gitlab-continous-integration-ci/)
  - [ ] Epic latex theme for listing books and articles of interest, could use my ENGR4Notes instead, or somewhat combine it with jinja, but probably just figure it out manually with a external file that I can reuse/copy paste elsewhere.
