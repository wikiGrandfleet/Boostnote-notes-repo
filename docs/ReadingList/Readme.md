#### Note taking rules

1. Any content domain specific goes in the corresponding repo, AI content goes to AI Notes, and Bchain content goes to BlockNotes, but smart contract related content can go anyway
2. After co-op terms, continue to seperate the domain specific content into AI and Blockchain, with some subnotes repo (smart contracts)
3. Everythin interesting I look at can be placed in ENGR Year 4 Notes.
